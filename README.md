## Anoetry

Animated poetry.

## Todo

* Optionally embed css and javascript files into the html, so that the anoem is a single html file.
* Should include the thesaurus, dictionary, translation objects as separate scripts.
* When compiling an anoem, look for a config in the directory of the source file, and use that one. Otherwise, use the default config.
* Flagged arguments? If so, specifying a config file could be nice.
